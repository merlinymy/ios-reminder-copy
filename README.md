# Reminder App
A lightweight, iOS-inspired reminder app, built entirely with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML—no frameworks, no libraries. This project is a testament to my capability of crafting a smooth, iOS-like experience using only vanilla web technologies.
# Project Purpose
This project was built to:

- Practice JavaScript modules (ES6+ import/export)
- Improve state management using modular structure
- Create an iOS-inspired UI with smooth interactions
- Utilize localStorage for persistent data
